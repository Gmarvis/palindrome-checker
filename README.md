# Simple Panlindrone Checker

A palindrome is a word, sentence, verse, or even number that reads the same backward or forward. It derives from Greek roots that literally mean “running back” (palin is “again, back,” and dromos, “running.”) The word appears to have been created in English based on these roots in the early 1600s.

This is web application is a Simple in its functionality that is checks if a word or a sectence is palindrome or not.
